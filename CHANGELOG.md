# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Coordinate `click`, `scroll`, and `drag` inputs are mapped from the
  returned (possibly downscaled) screenshot payload back to capture pixels,
  so clicks land where the agent saw them when the image was resized.
  Accessibility-tree targets are unchanged (already capture-space).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- The Pi package now exposes native `computer_use_linux_*` tools without a
  separate MCP adapter. One small loader stays active initially, then uses
  Pi's additive dynamic-tool loading to expose selected tools with their exact
  generated MCP schemas only when desktop control is needed.
- Pi keeps one lazily started, session-scoped computer-use-linux process,
  forwards cancellation, serializes desktop actions, preserves image results,
  bounds text output, and rejects binary/schema version drift.

### Changed
- Pi installation is now one command (`pi install
  npm:@agent-sh/computer-use-linux`) and no longer writes
  `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`. Existing adapter-based entries are detected and
  reported for non-destructive manual cleanup.

## [0.4.10] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- An explicitly opt-in `run_shell` MCP tool supports bounded same-user shell
  execution for trusted remote MCP deployments. The tool is absent unless
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_ENABLE_SHELL=1`, clears ambient credentials, requires
  visible environment additions, enforces timeout/output limits and process-
  group cleanup, and emits command-digest audit records.

### Fixed
- Wayland literal text now uses `wtype` on compatible compositors when portal
  keyboard input is unavailable, preserving Unicode before the ydotool
  fallback. Known-incompatible GNOME, KDE/Plasma, and COSMIC sessions do not
  advertise or select wtype, and a launched failure never replays the text.
- Absolute uinput pointer axes now end at the final logical desktop pixel, so
  edge coordinates are advertised and clamped consistently.
- Capability maps now advertise AT-SPI only when its bus is reachable and a
  toolkit accessibility status is actually enabled.
- Buttons outside the absolute uinput device's left, middle, and right set now
  fall through to a backend that can synthesize them instead of becoming left clicks.
- Temporary KWin script callbacks now accept one matching response from the
  current `org.kde.KWin` bus owner, reject spoofed or replayed responses, and
  time out the complete script transaction before cleaning up owned temporary
  state without disturbing a colliding callback registration.
- KWin window listings now classify Plasma 6 native Wayland and Xwayland
  clients when the legacy client flags are unavailable.
- GNOME extension setup now reports when changed files require an already-active
  Shell extension to reload before its newly installed DBus methods are served,
  and requires that reload when the previous extension state cannot be read.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- Bounded AT-SPI traversals now use concurrent indexed child reads, count both
  queued references and failed child lookups against their work budgets, and
  enforce a snapshot deadline so wide, malformed, or stalled accessibility
  trees cannot allocate or retain unbounded work.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- AT-SPI state capture now reaches deeply nested GTK4 controls such as Nautilus
  file cells by using a 1,000-node default budget and depth-32 traversal, with
  bounded 2,000-node and depth-64 limits shared by the MCP and CLI paths.
- `install.sh` now treats unavailable window-targeting or exact-focus support as
  a degraded platform capability when MCP registration, accessibility trees,
  and development input are ready, while missing core prerequisites remain hard
  failures. The same classification applies when `jq` is unavailable.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now recognizes Artix as pacman-based, chooses an explicitly
  requested or unambiguous package manager for unknown distros, treats
  ydotool as an optional fallback, installs the required xdotool keyboard
  backend on X11, distinguishes pointer-only direct uinput from keyboard-ready
  input in `doctor`, reports Wayland RemoteDesktop pointer availability
  separately from its required keyboard contract, and skips automatic ydotoold
  setup when a systemd user manager is unavailable.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- Native X11 coordinate clicks now use one supervised
  `xdotool mousemove -- X Y click --repeat N BUTTON` command after the
  absolute pointer and eligible portal paths, with `ydotool` fallback only
  when `xdotool` cannot be spawned. Standard left, middle, and right buttons
  are supported; extended buttons retain the existing fallback path. Set
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_YDOTOOL_POINTER=1` to skip xdotool.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- Stateful ydotool operations now complete while retaining the serialized input
  lock after caller cancellation, preventing paired button or key events from
  being interrupted. Drag also attempts button release after intermediate
  failures.
- Scaled KWin sessions now map logical window geometry through the compositor's
  virtual screen geometry while preserving logical portal input coordinates.
- Hyprland window bounds now map against grim's complete global output union,
  including negative origins and mixed or fractional scales, and are omitted
  when monitor metadata is unavailable or invalid.
- Mirrored KScreen outputs are excluded from the portal monitor layout.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- KWin window listing and activation now support both Plasma 6
  (`windowList`/`activeWindow`) and Plasma 5 (`clientList`/`activeClient`).
- ydotool is now used only when its CLI, daemon, and socket support the raw
  event semantics Computer Use emits. Compatibility probing works without
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, uses an isolated private socket, and rejects CLI errors
  that are returned with a successful exit status.
- X11 `xdotool type` now disables per-character delay, and a command that
  starts but fails is no longer replayed through ydotool. The ydotool fallback
  is limited to failures to launch xdotool, avoiding duplicate partial input.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- Hyprland window activation now checks `hyprctl dispatch` stdout instead of
  trusting its exit status, so an exit-zero `Invalid dispatcher` response falls
  through to the compatible focus dispatcher. (#62)
- Modifier chords sent through the ydotool fallback now include a 100 ms
  inter-event delay so applications such as Firefox do not drop simultaneous
  modifier and key events. (#63)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- X11 keyboard input now goes through `xdotool` (XTEST) instead of ydotool.
  ydotool injects raw evdev scancodes into a virtual uinput device, which X11
  re-interprets through the active XKB layout — so `press_key "Return"` and
  chords like `ctrl+a` landed as stray characters, and `type_text` mangled
  symbols and digits (`_` → `%`, `1` → `+`) even on a plain US layout. XTEST
  resolves keysyms against the live layout. Wayland behaviour is unchanged, and
  the ydotool path remains the fallback when `xdotool` is missing or fails.
  `doctor` now reports an `xdotool` input backend on X11. Override with
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_YDOTOOL_KEYBOARD=1` (opt out) or
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_XDOTOOL_KEYBOARD=1` (force on). (#58)
- Portal `scroll` direction on KDE Plasma Wayland: vertical discrete axis steps
  are inverted for the xdg-desktop-portal-kde discrete path so `direction:
  "up"|"down"` matches viewport motion. ydotool / REL_WHEEL polarity is
  unchanged. Override with `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_PORTAL_SCROLL_INVERT=0|1`. (#56)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Targeted `get_app_state` screenshots now crop to the resolved target window,
  and refuse the full-desktop fallback when a target was requested but window
  bounds cannot be resolved or the window is entirely off-screen. (#48)
- Hyprland window bounds are normalized against each window's monitor origin
  and fractional scale so portal screenshot coordinates align on
  multi-monitor and scaled (e.g. 1.8x/2.0x) setups. (#48)
- Wayland sessions are recognized via `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` when
  `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` is unavailable, so the portal input fallback engages in
  environments that don't export the session type. (#48)
- Window focus verification now allows up to one second for compositor
  workspace/focus transitions before reporting activation failure. (#48)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Generic X11/EWMH window backend so `list_windows`, `focused_window`,
  `activate_window`, `move_window`, and `resize_window` work on X11 window
  managers without a dedicated backend (Cinnamon/Muffin, MATE/Marco,
  Xfce/xfwm4, Openbox, and others). (#41)
- Pi coding agent extension package: `pi install npm:@agent-sh/computer-use-linux`
  now provides Linux desktop control tools through `pi-mcp-adapter`'s MCP
  proxy without a separate pi-specific skill. (#42)

### Fixed
- Hyprland 0.55 exact window focus: `activate_window` now tries the 0.55 Lua
  focus dispatcher (`hl.dsp.focus`) first and falls back to the legacy
  `focuswindow` dispatcher on older releases. (#45)
- Exported MCP tool schemas no longer carry the non-standard `uint`/`uint8`/
  `uint16`/`uint32`/`uint64`/`usize` `format` annotations emitted by
  `schemars`, which produced repeated warnings in MCP clients; integer types
  and numeric constraints are preserved. (#45)
- GNOME extension package bootstrap on Ubuntu no longer tries to install the
  nonexistent `gnome-shell-extension-tool` apt package; `gnome-shell` is
  installed only when `gnome-extensions` is missing and apt can provide it. (#40)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- A scroll with a window target but no x/y/element_index focused the window and
  then scrolled whatever sat under the cursor while reporting success.
  Window-targeted scroll now defaults its point to the centre of the resolved
  window (and errors with a pass-x/y hint when bounds are unavailable). Scroll
  results also gain the same off-screen coordinate warning click already had.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Exposed a focused Rust library surface for downstream diagnostics,
  accessibility snapshots, screenshots, and server integration while preserving
  the existing CLI binaries and standalone naming. (#35)
- Input-landing feedback: targeted keyboard input results append
  focused-element feedback from AT-SPI and warn when no editable element holds
  focus.
- Off-screen detection: screenshot, click, and input results warn when the
  target window or coordinate is partially or fully off-screen.
- Window geometry tools: `move_window` and `resize_window` via the GNOME Shell
  extension backend.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- GTK4 applications (Nautilus, Text Editor, baobab, and others) now return their
  full accessibility tree instead of a single `role: "unknown"` root with
  `child_count: 0`. Reads were routed through the `atspi` `P2P` trait's
  `object_as_accessible`, whose no-peer fallback builds a proxy with a path but
  no destination; on the shared a11y bus that fails with `ServiceUnknown` for
  any app that does not advertise a peer-to-peer bus address. Modern GTK4 apps
  do not implement the legacy `GetApplicationBusAddress`, so they hit the broken
  fallback while GTK3/Chromium/Electron apps kept working. Reads now use
  `ObjectRefExt::as_accessible_proxy`, which always pins the destination to the
  object's bus name. (#31)

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- Published a metadata-only patch release so local and downstream consumers can
  pin the already-validated `computer-use-linux` package state.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Window-relative clicks now require a verified target window and resolved
  bounds before coordinates are translated, preventing clicks from silently
  landing against stale or originless window data.
- Long `ydotool type --file -` input now gets a bounded timeout with both a
  fixed process budget and a text-length budget while stdout/stderr are drained
  asynchronously.
- KDE clipboard text input now uses the session DBus API directly and waits
  long enough for large paste payloads before restoring the previous clipboard;
  Klipper proxy creation and method calls share the same bounded DBus timeout.
- Failed accessibility tree extraction clears cached nodes so later
  element-targeted actions cannot use stale coordinates.

### Changed
- The COSMIC helper source path and runtime override surface now use standalone
  `computer-use-linux` naming only.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Screenshots now work from background processes (systemd user services,
  non-interactive parent shells) on GNOME Wayland. The GNOME Shell DBus method
  rejects callers that do not own an allowlisted bus name, and the XDG portal
  cancels non-interactive requests when there is no foreground window, so both
  prior backends failed in that context. `gnome-screenshot` is now a third
  capture fallback that works regardless of session context, bounded by a 20s
  timeout so a hung capture degrades to a clear error instead of blocking.

### Added
- `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_SCREENSHOT_BACKEND` to force a single screenshot backend
  (`gnome-shell`, `portal`, or `gnome-screenshot`), skipping the fallback chain
  for pinned/background deployments and debugging.
- `doctor` now probes `gnome-screenshot` and lists it under
  `capabilities.screenshot` when present.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Added build-time GNOME extension / DBus identity overrides (`CUL_*`) so the
  `codex-desktop-linux` embedded copy can share this source while keeping its
  Codex extension identity, plus runtime `CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_*` aliases for the
  embedded input/backend knobs.

### Documentation
- Cross-referenced the sibling `agent-workspace-linux` project in the README.

### Fixed
- Bounded screenshot payloads by default before returning them to MCP hosts,
  while exposing opt-in screenshot sizing controls and coordinate metadata for
  downscaled captures.
- Added opt-in JPEG screenshot output with a caller-selected quality so agents
  can choose compression before the byte cap forces additional resizing.
- Ported downstream Linux readiness fixes: `doctor` now treats direct
  `/dev/uinput` and the XDG RemoteDesktop portal as valid development-input
  backends instead of requiring `ydotoold` in every ready setup.
- Ported downstream session hydration fixes for X11 launches by carrying
  `XAUTHORITY` through environment hydration and checking the same-user namespace
  init process when it owns the graphical session environment.

### Security
- Pinned the release upload GitHub Action to a commit SHA in CI.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-25

Primarily a documentation release that refreshes the crates.io and npm README
pages; also bumps the MCP server's advertised version string to match.

### Added
- Documented the `screenshot` MCP tool and the `doctor` capability map, which
  were missing from the README tool list and the MCP safety-contract table.
- A new "Environment variables" section covering runtime overrides
  (`CU_DISABLE_ABS_POINTER`, the `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_PORTAL` /
  `FORCE_YDOTOOL` pointer and keyboard knobs) and the npm wrapper install knobs
  (`COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_BIN`, `DOWNLOAD_BASE`, `SKIP_DOWNLOAD`, `LOCAL_*`).

### Changed
- Stopped pinning explicit versions throughout the docs (README, npm README,
  Hermes skill). Install commands are now bare and download links use GitHub's
  `/releases/latest` redirect, so the docs no longer drift on every release.
- Dropped the `version` field from the Hermes skill frontmatter (optional per
  the agentskills.io standard) so it no longer mirrors the tool version.
- Friendlier README opening: warmer tagline and a verb-driven summary, with no
  sections removed.

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now reads the current `doctor` readiness schema
  (`.readiness.blockers`, empty array means ready) instead of the removed
  `.ready` / `.checks` fields, so a fully provisioned system reports ready
  instead of always failing the doctor step. Restored the `install.sh`
  executable bit. (#9)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- A `sync reminder` CI workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-reminder.yml`) that
  opens (or updates) a `codex-sync`-labeled issue when a merge to `main` touches
  the crate sources (`src/**`, `Cargo.toml`, `gnome-shell-extension/**`), so the
  change can be propagated into the `codex-desktop-linux` embedded copy with its
  codex naming re-applied.

### Changed
- Bumped to establish version-enumeration parity with the `codex-desktop-linux`
  embedded copy (`0.2.3-linux-alpha1`). The two crates are kept on the same
  enumeration on purpose: a mismatch signals that a sync between them is pending.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Added a uinput absolute pointer (`abs_pointer.rs`) that creates a private
  `ABS_X`/`ABS_Y` device mapped to the portal screenshot coordinate space, so
  clicks land at the requested pixel on multi-monitor / HiDPI setups instead of
  being distorted by pointer acceleration and fractional scaling. Wired into
  `click()` with `ydotool` fallback; opt out via `CU_DISABLE_ABS_POINTER`.
- Added a Hermes-compatible skill tap at `skills/computer-use-linux/SKILL.md`
  and an `agnix` CI gate for agent-sh skill/config hygiene.
- Added agent-sh project-health files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CODEOWNERS`.
- Synced upstream Linux Computer Use text-input improvements: Wayland remote
  desktop portal keyboard sessions, KDE/Plasma clipboard paste fallback for
  layout-safe `type_text`, and literal keysym typing on non-KDE Wayland
  sessions before falling back to `ydotool`.
- Synced upstream Hyprland/session hydration fixes, including systemd user
  environment discovery, common command path hydration, `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`
  inference, and rounded window-id disambiguation.

### Fixed
- Omitted the debug-only `received` echo field from the generated MCP
  `outputSchema` for `ActionOutput` and `ActivateWindowOutput`. `schemars`
  serialized `Option<serde_json::Value>` as the boolean schema `true`, which
  strict MCP clients (mcphub, Claude Desktop, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s
  `AssertObjectSchema`) reject, failing the whole `tools/list` response.
  Affected `click`, `drag`, `perform_action`, `press_key`, `scroll`,
  `set_value`, `type_text`, and `activate_window`. (#1)

### Changed
- Updated repository, release, package, and CI links from `avifenesh` to the
  `agent-sh/computer-use-linux` org repo.
- `setup_accessibility` and `doctor` now understand the AT-SPI
  `org.a11y.Status IsEnabled` path in addition to GNOME toolkit accessibility.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- npm wrapper package (`@agent-sh/computer-use-linux`) for Node.js users. It
  downloads and verifies the matching GitHub release binaries at install time.
- Tag-driven GitHub Actions publishing for crates.io and npm using repository
  secrets.
- CI release gates for locked Rust checks, clippy, tests, private rustdoc,
  cargo publish dry-run, cargo audit, npm wrapper smoke tests, and an MCP
  protocol/safety contract check.
- MCP `ToolAnnotations` that mark read-only observation tools separately from
  mutating desktop-control tools.

### Changed
- Switch the COSMIC protocol dependency from a pinned Git revision to the
  published `cosmic-protocols` `0.2.0` crate so `computer-use-linux` can be
  published on crates.io.
- Ship the `computer-use-linux-cosmic` helper alongside prebuilt release
  binaries and install it from `install.sh` so COSMIC window targeting works
  outside `cargo install`.
- Keep the MCP `serverInfo.version` aligned with the Cargo package version.
- Remove unused direct `libc` and `png` dependencies from the crate manifest.

### Documentation
- Add Hermes Agent CLI setup commands and clarify the registered MCP tool
  names / toolset.
- Add npm install instructions and fix the prebuilt binary install example to
  match the release assets, which are raw binaries with `.sha256` files rather
  than tar archives.
- Document the mutating-tool safety contract for MCP hosts and npm users.
- Pin README and npm README install examples to the released `0.2.1` packages
  and `v0.2.1` GitHub release assets.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Multi-compositor window targeting**: native backends for **KWin**
  (KDE Plasma), **Hyprland**, **i3**, and **COSMIC** Wayland alongside
  the existing GNOME Shell backend. Window listing, focus tracking, and
  activation now work across all five compositors with automatic backend
  selection at runtime.
- **COSMIC Wayland helper** (`computer-use-linux-cosmic` binary) that
  speaks the `zcosmic_toplevel_info_v1` and `zcosmic_toplevel_manager_v1`
  protocols, used by the main server when running under COSMIC.
- **`windowing/` crate-internal module** consolidating all backends behind
  a uniform `WindowBackend` trait, with a registry that picks the right
  backend per session.
- **Datagram ydotool socket support** in addition to the existing stream
  sockets. Aligns with `ydotoold`'s newer default and avoids a
  reconnection penalty per input event.
- **Raw-keycode keyboard input** path for ydotool, fixing keystroke
  delivery on layouts where the symbolic keysym path was unreliable.
- **Compact Linux accessibility trees** in `get_app_state` — deduplicated
  redundant container nodes for smaller, more focused snapshots.
- **Enriched AT-SPI state readback** — element states (`focused`,
  `selected`, `expanded`, `checked`, …) now flow through to the response
  schema for `get_app_state`.

### Changed
- Server-side rejection of empty window-backend results (returns a
  structured "no backend available" error instead of an empty list).
- Stale-client eviction in the chrome-extension host path on backend
  side (host binary itself not shipped here — see Removed).

### Removed
- **`codex-chrome-extension-host` binary** is intentionally not shipped
  in this fork — it is a Chrome native messaging host scoped to Codex
  browser automation (`com.openai.codexextension`), unrelated to the
  computer-use MCP. The cosmic helper binary is renamed to
  `computer-use-linux-cosmic` to match the project naming.

### Synced from upstream
- This release tracks
  [`ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux`](https://github.com/ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux)
  through commit `4d6fd96` (May 2026), then re-applies the rebrand
  (DBus names, env vars, GNOME extension UUID, cache-file prefixes).
  Upstream credit goes to ilysenko, mosesmrima, PinguuSS, and the
  original Codex contributors.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Initial public release as a standalone repository, extracted from
  [`codex-desktop-linux-local-stack`](https://github.com/avifenesh/codex-desktop-linux).
- Linux Computer Use MCP server (`computer-use-linux` binary) speaking
  [rmcp](https://docs.rs/rmcp) over stdio.
- 15 MCP tools: `doctor`, `setup_accessibility`, `setup_window_targeting`,
  `list_apps`, `get_app_state`, `list_windows`, `focused_window`,
  `activate_window`, `click`, `drag`, `scroll`, `press_key`, `type_text`,
  `perform_action`, `set_value`.
- AT-SPI accessibility tree with semantic element selectors (role / name /
  text / states) for `click`, `perform_action`, and `set_value`.
- GNOME Shell window targeting via the bundled
  `computer-use-linux@avifenesh.dev` Shell extension (DBus service
  `dev.avifenesh.ComputerUseLinux.WindowControl`), with automatic fallback to
  `org.gnome.Shell.Introspect` when the extension is not installed.
- Screenshot capture through GNOME Shell DBus (preferred) and
  `org.freedesktop.portal.Screenshot` (fallback). Supports full-screen,
  per-app, per-window, region, and per-element scopes.
- Input synthesis through the Wayland remote-desktop portal when available,
  falling back to `ydotool` / `ydotoold` for keystrokes and pointer events.
- Best-effort terminal-window enrichment: maps each terminal window to its
  active TTY and foreground process for targeted `type_text` / `press_key`.
- `doctor` subcommand reporting AT-SPI bus health, GNOME Shell introspection
  status, extension status, ydotool socket readiness, and portal coverage in
  a single JSON document.

### Architecture
- Wayland-first; X11 best-effort through AT-SPI + ydotool.
- Validated against GNOME 50.1 on Wayland (Ubuntu 25.10).
- KDE / Sway / Hyprland untested — see README support matrix.
